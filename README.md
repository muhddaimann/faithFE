Employee-first staff management app

## About

### Mission  
Empower employees with clarity, transparency, and control over their work life—without stress or confusion.

### Problem  
Employees often feel disconnected from HR systems:
- Attendance and leave records are unclear
- Approvals feel slow or opaque
- Payslips and documents are scattered
- Feedback only comes once a year
- Existing HR apps feel cold, complex, or manager-first

### Outcome  
- Clear visibility into work records
- Fewer misunderstandings with HR
- Reduced admin stress
- Stronger trust between employees and company

### Positioning  
An **employee-first staff companion app** — not a surveillance tool, not a bloated HR system.
